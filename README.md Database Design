# ALX-Airbnb-Database-Project-
##Overview 
This project is part of the ALX software engineering program 
The goal is to **design and build a robust relation database**for an Airbnb like application 
It focuses on database design ,normalization schema creation ,and seeding with realistic data 
By completing this task ,i will gain hands on experience in ;
Relational database design and modelling 
Applying normalization principles(up to #NF)
Writing SQL scripts (DDL&DML)

Simulating production level database system 
collaboration using GitHub repositories and professional documentation 
###Key Tasks 
###**Task0;ER Diagram**
Defined entities and relationships for the data base (Users, properties,Bookings ,Reviews,Payment )
Created an ER diagram to visualize the design 
Files:('/ERD')(./ERD)

###Task1:** Normalization **
Revoewed schema for redundancy and ensured complience with **Third Normal form(3NF) **
-Documentend normalization ** steps with explantaion 
-Files :{'/Normalization '}(./Normalization )
###**Task 2: Schema creation**
-SQL, DDL scripts to define the databae schema 
-includes primary keys,foreign keys,and indexes for performance 
###**Task 3: Data Seeding ** 
-SQL,DML scripts to populate the database with **Realistic Airbnb -like data**
-simulates users,properties ,booking,payment and reviews
